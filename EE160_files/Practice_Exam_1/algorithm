Algorithm for MPG:

1. Enter the first data points from the cars computer
2. Then compute the first Instaneous MPG
3. Then print that first Instaneous MPG
3. After that, keep getting data points from the car's computer until it
stops.
4. While continously getting data points, re-enter the milelage values and 
gas consumed values, compute for those values in MPG, and contiuously print 
them.
5. Also, while all of this is going on, keep a tally of Instantaneous MPG's
collected and add all of the Instantaneous MPG's up.
6. Once all data files are entered, Compute for the Average MPG and show
the user the amount of readings computed and the Average we just computed.
