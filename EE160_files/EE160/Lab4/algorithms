Algorithm for temptble.c:

1. Scanf the starting and stopping temperatures
2. Convert Fahrenheit to Celsius with tocelius driver.
3. Assign numbers to variables.
4. Make start printf of table with starting temperature of Celsius and
fahrenheit
5. loop add 5 to Fahrenheit until it reaches the stop temperature and print
the conversation of that to  the celsius conversion.

Algorithm for account.c

1. declare floats and integers
2. Entering your initial account amount
3. Start the first while statement (when account amount isnʻt equal to zero)
4. Enter the annual interest rate and years compounded
5. Start your second while statement. (When years doesn’t equal to the compounded years, which will eventually add up to the years entered)
6. Using the equation given from the lab.
7. Adding to the compounded years by 1
8. Looping that until the compounded years equal to the years entered
9. Then printing the final results
10. Reinitializing the program by entering in the initial amount again and repeating previous steps 3 through 10 until 0 is entered.
