I feel that these ratings are generally accurate, even though at times I felt
I was tutoring my partner. I'm happy with keeping my score for myself 
conservative and I believe that I fulfilled the requierments decently to have
earned myself a "Very Good" effort rating. 
For my partner, I feel that he was decently prepared even though I did have
to help him at times. He never truely quit, which was good, and also was very
cooperative/flexible with his times that he could work on this HW. He was 
consistant in completing his part of the HW and did a very good job when he 
did.
I feel overall that these ratings are well assigned, especially seeing as we
are a duo coding team, so I stand by my efforts rating for this perticular HW
assignment.
